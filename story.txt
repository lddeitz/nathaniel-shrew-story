Once upon a time there was a young shrew named Nathaniel. Nathaniel loved playing in the forest with his other shrew friends, but hated every winter because he'd have to hibernate. One winter, Nathaniel decided to move down to Florida...but he got stuck there.  It's a hard time for Nathaniel, but this story is about Florida man helping him get back home...

CHAPTER ONE

March 28

For Nathaniel, Florida wasn't much of a shrew state. He thought maybe it would be, but it had been 3 months. Winter was already over, he reflected. He was at the bus stop, waiting for something...he wasn't sure what exactly anymore. 

"You look like you've had one bad day," he heard a gruff voice say. Nathaniel turned his head to see a man in an alligator shirt and shades peering down at him. "I'd offer you something for your troubles, but heck - I ain't ever been one for unrequested generosity."

Nathaniel blinked. The man sat down, his shadow eclipsing the small forest dweller. He smelled like diesel fuel. "So where you headed?"
